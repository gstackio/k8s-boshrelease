  Runs a lightweight tests against the Kubernetes cluster, using a
  bespoke test container image for validating the scheduling, log
  retrieval, and arbitrary process execution.

  For air-gapped environments, the test container can be relocated
  to an internal registry, or built entirely from scratch.  Just
  override the `images.smoke-test` property accordingly.

      Where to pull the k8s BOSH release Docker image for smoke tests.
      If you need to run in an air-gapped network, or just want to inspect the contents
      of your components manually, you can rebuild this image and push it into a private
      registry.

    description: |
      The smoke-test errand does its work inside of a single Kubernetes
      namespace, which gets created anew on each run, and torn down after.
      You can set a prefix for the automatically generated named here.
