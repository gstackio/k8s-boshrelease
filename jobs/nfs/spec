  This job enables NFS support on the VM, allowing Kubernetes to
  take advantage of exported NFS storage for shared volumes.

  It only installs the Debian/Ubuntu kernel- and user-space packages,
  and sets up rpcbind / idmap; it does NOT configure any exports.

packages:
  - nfs-packages

templates: {}
  # bin/pre-start: bin/pre-start
  # bin/post-stop: bin/post-stop
